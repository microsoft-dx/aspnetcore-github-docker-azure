# Connect to your VM using Bash (For Mac, Linux and Windows 10 with Bash installed)


1. SSH into your VM. Make sure you replace "myUserName" with your VM's user name and the url should be your DNS (remember the FQDN?) or the IP from the VM's details. 
    ```Shell
    ssh myUserName@myDomainName.cloudapp.azure.com
    ```

1. Since its a new connection you will have to confirm adding the key to the list of known hosts.
    ```Shell
    The authenticity of host 'myDomainName.cloudapp.azure.com (14.81.161.17)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Fy9G/qkO9msNo6JpcBT3SL4Qz1BMWB9iasTAJ6VrvjbPS.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes [Type 'yes' and enter]
    Warning: Permanently added 'myDomainName.cloudapp.azure.com,14.81.161.17' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    ```
    And because we are securing our SSH session with SSH-RSA (type of key), we will not be prompted for the VM's password. But you will be asked for the private key's passphrase if you defined one when you created it.
    ```Shell
    [myUserName@vm-name ~]$
    ```

**WE ARE IN!**

*Note: If the server is asking you for a password, but you set up a passwordless connection, it could mean that SSH is not finding your pair of keys on this terminal session. Use `ssh -v` option to make it easier to find the problem with a verbose connection.
You may need to make sure that your key is valid and is set to your terminal with `ssh-add` read [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17846529/could-not-open-a-connection-to-your-authentication-agent).
You can also specify that you are using the correct SSH key with `ssh -i path/to/key`.
In the worst case scenario, remember you can reset your SSH key and user name in the portal.*

## Customize your connection using the `~/.ssh/config` file (For Mac, Linux and Windows 10 with Bash installed)

Your life can be easier if you can create a `config` file on `.ssh` folder. Open a new terminal in you local machine

```Shell
touch ~/.ssh/config
nano ~/.ssh/config
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

You can take the following lines as an example, just make sure to replace the relevant information and save it after you are done:

```Shell
Host myVM
    HostName myDomainName.cloudapp.net
    User myUserName
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

*NOTE: Make sure that the identity file is the private key (not the `.pub` file) that you created in the **"Create an SSH key"** step, it should be right next to the `.pub` file but without an extension or with the `.key` extension.

With this change done you can easily start your SSH connection by only using the Host you defined in the config file, you don't longer need to remember the user name nor the parameters or each VM.

```Shell
    ssh myVM
```
