The first thing you need is to install ASP .NET on your machine. You can do this [by going to the Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) and select the installation method according to your platform: Windows, macOS or Linux.

In order to verify the installation, you can run the `dotnet` command in your environment of choice (it can be Bash on Windows, or CMD, or PowerShell on macOS, Linux or Windows, or any other termninal).
